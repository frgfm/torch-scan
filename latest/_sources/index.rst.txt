TorchScan: inspect your PyTorch models
======================================

The :mod:`torchscan` package provides tools for analyzing your PyTorch modules and models. Additionally to performance benchmarks, a comprehensive architecture comparison require some insights in the model complexity, its usage of computational and memory resources.


This project is meant for:

* |:zap:| **exploration**: easily assess the influence of your architecture on resource consumption
* |:woman_scientist:| **research**: quickly implement your own ideas to mitigate latency
